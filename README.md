Store Web Application for Flower Shop using MVC

this project uses the same store type as p0, a flower shop. it uses the same azure sql database as was used in p0. 
it allows a user to now view the flower shop from a website rather than console app. the user can:

1. create a new user log in
2. log in as an existing user
3. place an order for flowers, including a cart which allows a user to order multiple products at once
4. view store locations
5. view store inventory
6. view past order history
