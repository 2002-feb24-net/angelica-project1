Store Web Application for Flower Shop using MVC
The functioning Solution in this repo is named FlowerShop. 

This project uses the same store type as p0, a flower shop. It uses the same Azure SQL database as was used in p0. 
It allows a user to now view the flower shop from a website rather than console app. 

on the website Customer tab:
CRUD Operations - create a customer, see all customers, edit a customer, delete a customer
